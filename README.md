## Overview About The Project
##### As part of the challenge, Spotify introduced The Million Playlist Dataset, which is a dataset of 1 million playlists consisting of over 2 million unique tracks by nearly 300,000 artists1. This represents the largest public dataset of music playlists in the world
## Goal Of The Project
##### The primary goal is to create an automatic playlist continuation program. This means that when given a seed track or list of seed tracks, the algorithm should be able to predict the subsequent tracks in the playlist. This challenge aimed to push the boundaries of music recommendation and enhance the user experience on Spotify by making playlists more personalized and engaging.
